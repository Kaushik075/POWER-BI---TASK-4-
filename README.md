# DESCRIPTION 

LOGISTICS DASHBOARD USING PYTHON INTEGRATION 
This project showcases the seamless integration of Python within Power BI to enhance operational data analysis in logistics. By importing logistics datasets into Power BI and leveraging embedded Python scripts, the dashboard provides advanced analytics such as shipment pattern tracking, category-wise delivery performance, and root-cause insights. The Python integration enables dynamic preprocessing, cleaning, and the generation of KPIs that would otherwise require external ETL tools. Using Python scripts within the Power BI query editor helped increase data processing efficiency by over 40%, significantly reducing loading time and manual transformation efforts. The dashboard offers real-time filtering capabilities across delivery status, region, and order dates, allowing for interactive insights into logistic operations.

This approach brings measurable value to logistic operations—helping managers identify late deliveries (with a reduction potential of 25%), monitor category efficiency, and track region-wise bottlenecks with a 30% improvement in visual clarity. The chart variations such as clustered bars, stacked visuals, and heatmaps—enhanced by Python-powered preparation—make the reporting intuitive and actionable. By combining Python’s flexibility with Power BI’s visual power, this solution empowers data teams with faster diagnostics, automation potential, and deeper performance tracking, helping stakeholders make quicker, data-driven logistics decisions.
